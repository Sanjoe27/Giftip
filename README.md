# Giftip
1) Providing additional income to waiters for better lifestyle
2) Helping restaurant owners by adding google ratings and  reviews ,which will increase their customer count
3) Making 5% income from every transaction ,where all the waiters are happy to give


## Problem Statement : 
Recently i went to a restaurent with my family and the waiter who served us hospitalized very well ,I thought of giving him some tip but I'm just using my mobile for payments via UPI and my father is carrying only 500 and 2000 notes and there is no change with us,and I know I'm not capable of giving that big amount as tip ,And the restaurent owner don't tolerate such tips because it may affect his business ,I was helpless for him at that moment.

## Product Building :
As a App Developer & a Product Enthusiast i need to create something that should help them.Then i digged deep into the investigation of the problem. I went to the same restaurent i asked him "how things are going ?".
Then he replied "Previously ,before this phonepe,googlepay,paytm apps were not introduced we would have get enough tips ,even thought our salaries were pretty less these tips used to clear all our neccesities,but in this so called modern era "Digital Payments",people are not carrying any money with them instead using UPI. This rapid decreased our income, it became very hard to survive"

So this even boosted me to create something for them.
I came up with a web application named "GifTip"(Gifting in the form of tip)

Home page :


1) Idea is to provide tips to waiters using this web application.
2) we just need their photo(to identify him) and UPI QR Code(to make payment to them).
3) The access will be given to restaurent owners and he'll upload the photo and qr code of the waiter.
4) A new page will be created on the restaurent name which contains picture of the waiter and by clicking on the waiter ,we will be redirect to payment gateway as the backend procedure will be done(redirect to waiters account as he gave his qr code)
5) Now just select the mode of payment and make the payment.


## Actual Problem :
The major problem is all the restaurents owners are not same and few are not ready to provide personal details of their customers. So to solve this problem I enhanced the application much more ,
In the 5th step ,just soon after the payment ,it will redirect us to the restaurents google review page ,Pscyology-As the waiters service is good it would be to directly proportional to good impression about the restaurent too.So he'll give the ratings & review.

We all know that ,for business google ratings & reviews are very important. Using our application restaurents can boost their ratings & reviews ,which can recommend to many users near by. So that the restaurent owners can get good business.
